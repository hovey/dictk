# dictk

Digital Image Correlation Toolkit

`dictk` is a Python library for digital image correlation (DIC) — comparing
images of a specimen before and after deformation to measure displacement
and strain fields.

This is an early-stage skeleton: a small, real, tested primitive
(zero-normalized cross-correlation) rather than a full DIC pipeline.

## Installation

```bash
pip install dictk
```

## Usage

```python
import numpy as np
from dictk import zero_normalized_cross_correlation

a = np.array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
b = np.array([[2.0, 4.0], [6.0, 8.0]])

zero_normalized_cross_correlation(a, b)  # 1.0
```

## Development

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management.

```bash
uv sync --all-extras --dev
uv run pytest --cov=src/dictk
uv run ruff format --check
uv run ruff check
```

Documentation (mdBook) lives in `docs/userguide/`:

```bash
mdbook build docs/userguide
mdbook serve docs/userguide  # live preview at http://localhost:3000
```
