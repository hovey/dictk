"""mdbook preprocessor: number every `<figure>` by section and page order.

Each figure's caption gains a label such as "Figure 9.2-1:": the page's
section number from `SUMMARY.md`, then the figure's order on that page.
A caption that already starts with a hand-written "Figure:" has that
text replaced by the label. Each figure without an `id` also gains one,
such as `figure-9.2-1`. Pages without a section number are left
unchanged.

Cross-references: a Markdown link whose text is exactly `Figure` and
whose target ends in a figure's `id`, such as `[Figure](#fig-polar)` or
`[Figure](./kernel_warping.md#fig-panels)`, has its text replaced by
that figure's label, such as "Figure 2-3". Inside HTML, such as a
`<figcaption>`, where Markdown links don't render, write
`<a href="#fig-polar">Figure</a>` instead. Give a cited figure its own
descriptive `id`, so the reference survives reordering. A link to an
unknown `id` stays as written and prints a warning.

mdbook calls this script twice: once as `figure_number.py supports
<renderer>`, which exits 0 for every renderer, and once with the
`[context, book]` JSON on stdin, expecting the edited book on stdout.
